**
* This is the .ssc or Sprite Script File extension.
*
* This is a file type that is designed to work with a custom
* sprite loader and animator for bonzai brawl 2017.  Just script
* out the information you want for your animation here and the
* sprite loader will handle the rest!
*
* USAGE:
* The order in which the parser will read the file is as follows
*   NAMES:            EXPLANATION:
*   sprite_sheet      (Name of sprite sheet)
*   size_x            (width of a single frame)
*   size_y            (height of a single frame)
*   padding_x         (the x-axis padding between individual frames)
*   padding_y         (the y-axis padding between rows)
*   num_rows          (the number of actions that are in the sprite sheet)
*
* These next few data columns are repeatable.
*   action            (the name of the action that the row represents)
*   columns           (the number of frames that are used in this action)
*   ...
*
* To terminate the read process use the string END on its own line.
*
* THE INFORMATION MUST BE PRESENTED IN THE ABOVE ORDER!
*
* IMPORTANT:
* The names are for human readability.  You do not need to include them.
* you do, however need to include the ":=" as the parser will look for that
* string to find were it will begin reading it's next piece of data.
*
* You must also include the ";" at the end of a statement to indicate when data
* reading should finish.  Also the next piece of data needs to be on the next line.
*
* Finally, any lines that begin with a "*" will be ignored.  These lines are
* useful for commenting.
*
* Here is an example of the scripting:
* sprite_sheet    :=BlueSoldier.png;
* size_x          :=100;
* size_y          :=100;
* padding_x       :=0;
* padding_y       :=0;
* num_rows        :=1;
* action          :=March;
* columns         :=2;
* END
