This is the BonzAI2017 Competition game.

There are 2 ways to compile your AI to test it, the first is
to use the eclipes and file located in AIAntFiles/build.xml
or the shell script buildai

If you plan to compile through eclipse:
	1. Changes view to ant
	2. click on the ant button with the plus on it and select AIAntFiles/build.xml
	3. when you are ready to complie, click on build_ai and click on the play button to compile
	   and test your AI.

If you plan to compile through the command line:
	1. Navigate to the directory containing the src folder
	2. use the command ./buildai
	*******Note: if the script is ended prematurely, you may be in a different
	*******	     folder than when you started, just switch back to the parent 
	*******	     directory and try again
	3. enjoy

If you want to run the castles jar without compiling your AI, you MUST navigate the the BonzAI2017 sub folder
inside of the BonzAI2017 parent folder and use the command:
	java -jar castles.jar
Otherwise the communication won't work between the AI's and the host.  Thank you for your cooperation.


In order for your AI to compile correctly and run, make sure to change the
@Agent annotation at the top of your ai to reflect your team name, faliure to
do so will risk disquallificaiton.
